[![WolfDan's github stats](https://grs.neet.club/api?username=WolfDan&show_icons=true&theme=tokyonight)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

Hey! I'm a self-taught backend programmer! Interested on distributed systems, databases, video game servers and new technologies!

In depth love with [Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir) but I also know plenty of other languages such as C#, Rust, Python, Reasonml (ReScript)! And eager to learn more!

If you want to know more about me there's not much left to say that I'm a music lover and I like anime and video games a lot

**Remote jobs only, but feel free to contact me in any case**
